Principle 1: Equitable Use

- All features are accessible to all users no matter whether they are Students or Faculty


Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

- Pomodoro timer is adjustable, so users can set their own preference
- Events section is fully customizable, users can add their own schedule into the events
- Button sizes are adequate size to facilitate the users accuracy and precision

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use:

- UI design is easy to understand and find functions, first button: homepage, second button: events, third button: posts, fourth button: Me
- Toast popups to show successful event creation / posting / login

- Parts that did not follow well: 
    - Posts needs to arrange posts by posting time
    - App only has English

Principle 4: Perceptible Information

- Choice of colours for features such as buttons / app text helps maximize “legibility” (the quality of being clear enough to read)
- Color choice also provides adequate contrast to the text and all of its surroundings (for example black on white good,  yellow on white bad)
- The add post button uses “+” which intuitively represent add post which replaces the redundant presentation of “add post”

- Parts that did not follow that well:
    - Didn’t use pictorial verbal or tactile modes for redundant presentation of essential information (Back button can be changed to arrow)

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

- Events provided Toast warning to show whether or not the events were created successfully / unsuccessfully
- Posts provided Toast warning to show whether or not the posts were successfully posted and whether or not the posts were unsuccessful
- Posts wouldn’t create posts if there was no title as it would break the database since the titles are the key for the databases


Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

- Events moved the create event and cancel buttons onto the bottom of the screen in order to minimize finger travel distance
- Posts provided well Low physical effort in replying to posts, where the text input bar is lower down to the bottom of the screen to reduce finger movement

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

- We did not implement this principle well. Most of our button sizes are set however their location is relative to the size of the screen
- If the user had smaller hands and a bigger screen, it might be hard to reach some of the buttons that are further away


2. Our program will be marketed towards but not limited to University of Toronto Faculty and Students. We hope to expand our application in the future to encompass more university campuses. The app is an all in one socialization / organizational app for people who have any stake in University of Toronto.

3. Our program most likely won’t be used by people that are outside of / have no affiliation with University. The app is targeted for University stakeholders and can only be logged onto by people who have email addresses affiliated with a university. Therefore most / if not all users will be people who have university affiliation.
