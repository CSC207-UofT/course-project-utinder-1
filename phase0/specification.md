## Specification

From this project, we would like to create an Android app that provides both academic and
social assistance for the students at the University of Toronto.

* When we start to run the project/app, the first page shown is a log-in page. 
  * The user needs to use their corresponding UT email, their username and password for authentication. 
* After successfully login to the app, the user will see the main page consisting of all the menus they can access to. 
* In the *Course* menu, the user can find the following features:
  * Uploading their own course schedules and share with other users
  * Creating/joining a group chat for the course the user is enrolled in
  * Managing deadlines for all the upcoming assignments or tests for any courses
* In the *Community* tab, the user allows to use the following features:
  * Posting about anything they want to share 
    * They can also anonymously post it!
  * Clicking like/dislike buttons for the posts
  * Leaving comments to any posts
  * Joining a group of people who have the same hobbies or interests
