## Specification

From this project, we would like to create an Android app that provides both academic and
social assistance for the students at the University of Toronto.

* When we start to run the project/app, the first page shown is a log-in page. 
  * The user needs to use their corresponding UT email, their username and password for authentication. 
* After a successful login to the app, the user will see the main page consisting of all accessible menus. 
* In the *Events* menu, the user can find the following features:
  * EventsTable - Where users can upload courses, events and deadlines to create a sharable timetable with other users.
  * Create/join group chats for enrolled courses
  * Manage deadlines for all upcoming assignments / tests for any courses
* In the *Community* tab, the user can use the following features:
  * Post about anything they want to share 
    * They can also anonymously post it!
  * Ability to like/dislike posts
