## Scenario Walk-Through


When the User tries to register to the app, the User needs to
* type their UT email, password, nickname
* declare their status: Student, Faculty, or Guest

By receiving the user information, the UserManager will create an account
for the user and add the newly created User to UsersTable.

If they successfully register, then they will be able to see the page
which says that "Success!".
