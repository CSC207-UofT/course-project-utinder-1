## Scenario Walk-Through


When the User tries to register to the app, the User needs to
* type their UT email, password, nickname
* declare their status: Student, Faculty, or Guest

By receiving the user information, the system will create an instance
 of this user and store it to the database.

If they successfully register, then they will be able to see the page
which says that "Success!".
