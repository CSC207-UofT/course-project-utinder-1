## Scenario Walk-Through

From this Scenario Walk-Through, we would like to mainly test User, UserManager, and UserData classes when the user registers to the app/log in to the app. 

In the beginning, the User will see the "Welcome to UTinder" page, and they need to click the button "Get Started". 

When the User tries to log in, the User needs to type their **username** and **password**.
Then, after clicking the **LOGIN** button, if everything is correct, then the User will be able to see the message "Sign in Completel!" and a loading page. 
Otherwise, the User will see the message "It's wrong", and they need to retype the username and password.
