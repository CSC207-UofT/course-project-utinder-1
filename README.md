## UTinder

This project is about creating an Android app, called *UTinder*, that fulfills
academics and community for the University of Toronto students. 

You can download this entire repo and run the Android App on IntelliJ. However, you need to use Utinderlogin-master directory to run the app as the mentioned directory is connected to the database.
