## UTinder

This project is about creating an Android app, called *UTinder*, that fulfills
academics and community for the University of Toronto students. 

You can download this entire repo and run the Android App on IntelliJ. However, you need to use **Utinderlogin-master** directory to run the app as the mentioned directory is connected to the database. 

For the case when the method above doesn't work, please use the following URL to our current skeleton program to run the app: https://github.com/Bantonio12/Utinderlogin
