## UTinder

This project is about creating an Android app, called *UTinder*, that fulfills
academics and community for the University of Toronto students. 

Please download the files from the following URL and run the app on your own Android studio: https://github.com/Bantonio12/Utinderlogin
However, you need to create `local.properties` file which stores the path of the sdk in your local computer. 

Ignore the android app files in this repository, this brought up some of the issues in running the app.
